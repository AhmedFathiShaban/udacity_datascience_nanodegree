# Analysis Of AirBnB Seattle Dataset

## This project is part of the udacity datascience nanodegree program.

## 1.0. Motivation : 
### In this project, my aim is to gain some insights from the AirBnB Seattle Dataset.
### Specifically, there are three main questions I would like to answer : 
(Q1) As a real-estate company that sells houses in Seatle, where should I focus my marketing campaigns ? Assume we have a budget for campaigns in 10 different locations.Â¶

(Q2) As a place owner in seattle, which renting model should I use to maximize my average profit ?

(Q3) As a tourist who travels alone with low budget and flexibility of free time, which month of the year would be cheapest for me to have a vacation in Seatle ? Also which neighbourhood should I target if I am not so picky ?

## 2.0. Libraries Used 
pandas (1.1.5)
matplotlib (3.3.3)
